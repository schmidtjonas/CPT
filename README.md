# CPT
competitive programming template

to add a new task use:
``./cpt exampleContest numberOfProblems``

A new folder called exampleContest will be created in the contests folder and is added to the cmake build system.
The new folder contains numberOfProblems contests files with my current c++ template. All left to do is implement your main!

The script uses `mysides` on macos to add the contest folder to your finder sidebar.
